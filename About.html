               <p>
                In 2014 I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. It shaped me and gave me the foundational leadership that I have developed over the last 8 years. 
                Through the ups and downs of service I have learned some very substantial things. Investing in exceptional leadership is the secret to success.
                The job will always get done, stressing the little things is not worth it. Kindness is a science, it is proven that kindness
                makes us happier, increases energy levels, its good for the heart, slows aging and reducecs stress. Even though my service to my nation is over, 
                I still want to continue to serve my family, my community, my nation and the world. I believe by becoming a software developer I can contribute 
                to society in a meaningful way. The skills I have learned in life combined with the skillset I have learned during the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy
                will help me acheive my goals.
